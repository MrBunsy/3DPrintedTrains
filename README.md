# 3DPrintedTrains

Various attempts to 3D print OO gauge trains and accessories.

## Couplings

I've had some success at producing an equivilant to Hornby's X8031. This is compatible with Bachman's trucks as well (at least the ones from the 90s). With the hook holder, it is slightly wider than the original, so may not fit all situations (I can't mount them on a hornby loco). The version without the hook should fit.

## Truck Base

I'm still looking into ways to attach a top half to the truck, and this is only a prototype for testing dimensions, no modelled to look like a real truck yet.

## Buffers

0.2mm layer height without brim seems to print well.

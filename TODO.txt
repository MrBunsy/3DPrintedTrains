General Bits:

 - Tidy up of coupling fixings - currently they were mostly designed around the truck base and are fiddly to re-use for anything else.

MWA Wagon:

 - Fixing for 3-pronged brake wheel on the bogie for MWA-B variant
 
Wagon/Truck:

 - plank wagon top
 - Check dimensions, mineral wagons were well defined and my truck base was designed around holding a pi, not being accurate.
 
Intermodal Wagon
 
 - (long term) split into FSA/FYA (I think those were the right names) with the different height for buffers and wagons. Probably not worth the effort since the single wagon looks pretty good.
